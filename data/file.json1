The Carnegie group of companies, together “Carnegie”,\ngenerates added value for institutions, companies and private clients in the areas of trade in securities, investment banking and private banking.\nCarnegie has approximately 600 employees, located in offices in six countries.\nRatings and risk assessment structure\nCurrent rating system as of October 2011\nBuy (B): an upside of at least 10% to target price and with an attractive risk/reward profile.\nHold (H): the shares are trading close to their target price and are fairly valued.\nSell (S): unattractive risk/reward ratio as the shares are trading above their target price.\nNot rated (NR), Under review (UR), Under bid (UB): the investment rating, if any, has been suspended temporarily.\nRisk assessment\nThe risk assessment is based on the analyst’s evaluation of the company’s equity beta based on the business risk (asset beta) and financial risk\n(gearing).\nLow risk Estimated equity beta <0.75\nMedium risk Estimated equity beta 0.75 to 1.25\n\fHigh risk Estimated equity beta >1.25\nValuation, methodology, and assumptions\nTarget price\nCarnegie publishes a target price for most of the stocks in our Research Universe. The target price is the analyst's assessment of expected total return\nover the coming six to 12 months based on various fundamental valuation methods. A commonly used method is DCF valuation, where future cash\nflows are discounted to today. Analysts may also use different valuation multiples, e.g. P/E ratio and EV/EBIT multiples, relative to industry peers to\nobtain a target price. For companies where it is appropriate, a target price can also be based on the analyst’s assessment of a fair ratio relative to the\nnet asset value of the company. Target prices are revised when earnings and cash flow forecasts are changed. Thus, changes to estimates are a key risk\nto the target price. Other reasons for revising target prices include changes in the underlying value of a company’s assets and when factors affecting\nthe required rate of return change, which can also be seen as risk factors to the target price.\n\n\nInformation\nYou will find detailed information about the valuation or methodology and the underlying assumptions on Carnegie Edge (www.carnegie-edge.com). The\ncomplete history of research reports and previous recommendations can also be found on Carnegie Edge.\n\n\nResearch coverage\nCarnegie’s research analysis consists of case-based analyses, which implies that the frequency of the analytical report may vary over time.

The Carnegie group of companies, together “Carnegie”, generates\nadded value for institutions, companies and private clients in the areas of trade in securities, investment banking and private banking. Carnegie has\napproximately 600 employees, located in offices in six countries.\nRatings and risk assessment structure\nCurrent rating system as of October 2011\nBuy (B): an upside of at least 10% to target price and with an attractive risk/reward profile.\nHold (H): the shares are trading close to their target price and are fairly valued.\nSell (S): unattractive risk/reward ratio as the shares are trading above their target price.\nNot rated (NR), Under review (UR), Under bid (UB): the investment rating, if any, has been suspended temporarily.\nRisk assessment\nThe risk assessment is based on the analyst’s evaluation of the company’s equity beta based on the business risk (asset beta) and financial risk (gearing).\nLow risk Estimated equity beta <0.75\nMedium risk Estimated equity beta 0.75 to 1.25\nHigh risk Estimated equity beta >1.25\nValuation, methodology, and assumptions\nTarget price\nCarnegie publishes a target price for most of the stocks in our Research Universe. The target price is the analyst's assessment of expected total return\nover the coming six to 12 months based on various fundamental valuation methods. A commonly used method is DCF valuation, where future cash flows\nare discounted to today. Analysts may also use different valuation multiples, e.g. P/E ratio and EV/EBIT multiples, relative to industry peers to obtain a\ntarget price. For companies where it is appropriate, a target price can also be based on the analyst’s assessment of a fair ratio relative to the net asset\nvalue of the company. Target prices are revised when earnings and cash flow forecasts are changed. Thus, changes to estimates are a key risk to the\ntarget price. Other reasons for revising target prices include changes in the underlying value of a company’s assets and when factors affecting the\nrequired rate of return change, which can also be seen as risk factors to the target price.\n\n\nInformation\nYou will find detailed information about the valuation or methodology and the underlying assumptions on Carnegie Edge (www.carnegie-edge.com).

The Carnegie group of companies, together “Carnegie”,\ngenerates added value for institutions, companies and private clients in the areas of trade in securities, investment banking and private banking.\nCarnegie has approximately 600 employees, located in offices in six countries.\nRatings and risk assessment structure\nCurrent rating system as of October 2011\nBuy (B): an upside of at least 10% to target price and with an attractive risk/reward profile.\nHold (H): the shares are trading close to their target price and are fairly valued.\nSell (S): unattractive risk/reward ratio as the shares are trading above their target price.\nNot rated (NR), Under review (UR), Under bid (UB): the investment rating, if any, has been suspended temporarily.\nRisk assessment\nThe risk assessment is based on the analyst’s evaluation of the company’s equity beta based on the business risk (asset beta) and financial risk\n(gearing).\nLow risk Estimated equity beta <0.75\nMedium risk Estimated equity beta 0.75 to 1.25\n\fHigh risk Estimated equity beta >1.25\nValuation, methodology, and assumptions\nTarget price\nCarnegie publishes a target price for most of the stocks in our Research Universe. The target price is the analyst's assessment of expected total return\nover the coming six to 12 months based on various fundamental valuation methods. A commonly used method is DCF valuation, where future cash\nflows are discounted to today. Analysts may also use different valuation multiples, e.g. P/E ratio and EV/EBIT multiples, relative to industry peers to\nobtain a target price. For companies where it is appropriate, a target price can also be based on the analyst’s assessment of a fair ratio relative to the\nnet asset value of the company. Target prices are revised when earnings and cash flow forecasts are changed. Thus, changes to estimates are a key risk\nto the target price. Other reasons for revising target prices include changes in the underlying value of a company’s assets and when factors affecting\nthe required rate of return change, which can also be seen as risk factors to the target price.\n\n\nInformation\nYou will find detailed information about the valuation or methodology and the underlying assumptions on Carnegie Edge (www.carnegie-edge.com). The\ncomplete history of research reports and previous recommendations can also be found on Carnegie Edge.\n\n\nResearch coverage\nCarnegie’s research analysis consists of case-based analyses, which implies that the frequency of the analytical report may vary over time.

The Carnegie group of companies, together “Carnegie”, generates\nadded value for institutions, companies and private clients in the areas of trade in securities, investment banking and private banking. Carnegie has\napproximately 600 employees, located in offices in six countries.\nRatings and risk assessment structure\nCurrent rating system as of October 2011\nBuy (B): an upside of at least 10% to target price and with an attractive risk/reward profile.\nHold (H): the shares are trading close to their target price and are fairly valued.\nSell (S): unattractive risk/reward ratio as the shares are trading above their target price.\nNot rated (NR), Under review (UR), Under bid (UB): the investment rating, if any, has been suspended temporarily.\nRisk assessment\nThe risk assessment is based on the analyst’s evaluation of the company’s equity beta based on the business risk (asset beta) and financial risk (gearing).\nLow risk Estimated equity beta <0.75\nMedium risk Estimated equity beta 0.75 to 1.25\nHigh risk Estimated equity beta >1.25\nValuation, methodology, and assumptions\nTarget price\nCarnegie publishes a target price for most of the stocks in our Research Universe. The target price is the analyst's assessment of expected total return\nover the coming six to 12 months based on various fundamental valuation methods. A commonly used method is DCF valuation, where future cash flows\nare discounted to today. Analysts may also use different valuation multiples, e.g. P/E ratio and EV/EBIT multiples, relative to industry peers to obtain a\ntarget price. For companies where it is appropriate, a target price can also be based on the analyst’s assessment of a fair ratio relative to the net asset\nvalue of the company. Target prices are revised when earnings and cash flow forecasts are changed. Thus, changes to estimates are a key risk to the\ntarget price. Other reasons for revising target prices include changes in the underlying value of a company’s assets and when factors affecting the\nrequired rate of return change, which can also be seen as risk factors to the target price.\n\n\nInformation\nYou will find detailed information about the valuation or methodology and the underlying assumptions on Carnegie Edge (www.carnegie-edge.com). The\ncomplete history of research reports and previous recommendations can also be found on Carnegie Edge.\n\n\nResearch coverage\nCarnegie’s research analysis consists of case-based analyses, which implies that the frequency of the analytical report may vary over time.

The Carnegie group of companies, together “Carnegie”, generates\nadded value for institutions, companies and private clients in the areas of trade in securities, investment banking and private banking. Carnegie has\napproximately 600 employees, located in offices in six countries.\nRatings and risk assessment structure\nCurrent rating system as of October 2011\nBuy (B): an upside of at least 10% to target price and with an attractive risk/reward profile.\nHold (H): the shares are trading close to their target price and are fairly valued.\nSell (S): unattractive risk/reward ratio as the shares are trading above their target price.\nNot rated (NR), Under review (UR), Under bid (UB): the investment rating, if any, has been suspended temporarily.\nRisk assessment\nThe risk assessment is based on the analyst’s evaluation of the company’s equity beta based on the business risk (asset beta) and financial risk (gearing).\nLow risk Estimated equity beta <0.75\nMedium risk Estimated equity beta 0.75 to 1.25\nHigh risk Estimated equity beta >1.25\nValuation, methodology, and assumptions\nTarget price\nCarnegie publishes a target price for most of the stocks in our Research Universe. The target price is the analyst's assessment of expected total return\nover the coming six to 12 months based on various fundamental valuation methods. A commonly used method is DCF valuation, where future cash flows\nare discounted to today. Analysts may also use different valuation multiples, e.g. P/E ratio and EV/EBIT multiples, relative to industry peers to obtain a\ntarget price. For companies where it is appropriate, a target price can also be based on the analyst’s assessment of a fair ratio relative to the net asset\nvalue of the company. Target prices are revised when earnings and cash flow forecasts are changed. Thus, changes to estimates are a key risk to the\ntarget price. Other reasons for revising target prices include changes in the underlying value of a company’s assets and when factors affecting the\nrequired rate of return change, which can also be seen as risk factors to the target price.\n\n\nInformation\nYou will find detailed information about the valuation or methodology and the underlying assumptions on Carnegie Edge (www.carnegie-edge.com).
